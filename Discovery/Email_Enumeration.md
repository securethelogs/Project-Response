## Email Sources
Your email is often your online identity. Enterprises heavily reply on email as a source of communication. 
Emailing outside of the organisation to bring in business or support. Signing up for events or personal interests using your company email address. 
All of this is common and day to day life, but all of it leaves a trace. Someone in the chain must store your email address in order to communicate or supply a service. If left unprotected or exposed, it can be stolen. 
Here are a few other sources of information for gathering email addresses: 

- Social media sites such as LinkedIn
- Attendance logs (Third party sites)
- Company website
- Mail listings
- CVs (inc Job reference)
- Google (cached)
