Project response aim is to document simple techniques and processes that can be followed during multiple variations of events. Think of this as a baseline or a think tank rather than a template.  

The project will include scripts which are built to help defender and investigate attacks so that the risk and damage is dampened.

I will also be using this project to develop my skills, so if you think of anything of interest, or wish to help, please do let me know. 


# Defence Opportunity 
It's important to understand that you will be attacked at some point, it's more of a matter of when. Breaches do occur so it's important to have as much fondation as possible so that when it does happen, the damage is less or at least contained (As much as possible).
